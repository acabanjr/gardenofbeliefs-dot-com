		Daisy the Daffodil embarks on a journey through a magical garden where every flower represents a unique belief. From creativity to optimism, each flower claims their belief is best, leading to division in the once harmonious garden. With the gentle wisdom of two ancient trees, Daisy helps the flowers discover the power of acceptance and unity, and the garden blooms brighter than ever before.

		<blockquote>"As a kid, I had a book full of 'My Inventions,' a binder divided into various categories. It was full of my ideas. Detailed mock-ups ranging from clothing designs to video game concepts, and even blueprints for skyscrapers. I've always been creative and even more so, organized. These adjectives define my character and guide my approach to even the smallest details."</blockquote><br>

		<p>Andrés has always been drawn to creative pursuits. His combination of imagination and meticulous organization has shaped both his career and personal journeys. His passion for writing began in his teenage years, fueled by poetry and a love for essays. Though writing a book has been a long-held goal, it wasn’t until recently that the idea for a children’s book took root. After careful thought, especially regarding the illustrations, Andrés is proud to share his debut children’s book, <em>The Garden of Beliefs</em>, blending his love for storytelling with visual art.</p>
